# AI_Snake_Agent
AI plays snake game, with Q learning
- implemented snake game with pygame
- q learning network implemented through Pytorch Linear
- implementation uses 4 cardinal directions, along with food positioning relative to agent, and collision detection
  - agent learns to avoid collisions with window and body (check window collisions and body collisions)
  - collision potential calculated using future timestep
